# Consensus Fix: Miner Reward Handling in Parallel Execution

**Date**: 2025-10-30
**Severity**: CRITICAL - Consensus-breaking bug
**Status**: FIXED
**Branch**: `feature/parallel-transaction-execution-v3`

## Executive Summary

Two critical consensus-breaking bugs were discovered and fixed in the parallel execution path's miner reward handling. These bugs caused:

1. **Rewards invisible to transactions**: Miners could not spend their coinbase rewards in the same block
2. **Balance overwrite**: Existing balances were overwritten (not accumulated) when rewards were merged

Both bugs caused parallel execution to diverge from serial execution, breaking consensus and causing potential fund loss.

## Bug #1: Rewards Invisible to Transaction Execution

### Root Cause

**Parallel path** (BROKEN):
```rust
// parallel_chain_state.rs:553-557 (OLD CODE)
pub async fn reward_miner(&self, miner: &PublicKey, reward: u64) {
    self.balances.entry(miner.clone())        // ← Wrote to `balances` DashMap
        .or_insert_with(HashMap::new)
        .entry(TOS_ASSET.clone())
        .and_modify(|b| *b = b.saturating_add(reward))
        .or_insert(reward);
}
```

**Transaction execution** (reads from different cache):
```rust
// parallel_apply_adapter.rs:200-201
self.parallel_state.ensure_balance_loaded(account, asset).await?;  // ← Loads from storage
let balance = self.parallel_state.get_balance(account, asset);     // ← Reads from `accounts` cache
```

### Problem

- `reward_miner()` wrote to `ParallelChainState::balances` (DashMap)
- Transaction execution read from `ParallelChainState::accounts` (different DashMap)
- These two caches were **completely isolated** - no synchronization

### Impact

Miners could not spend their coinbase rewards in the same block, causing:
- Functional regression (serial path allows this)
- Consensus divergence between parallel and serial nodes

### Fix

**Modified `reward_miner()` to use `accounts` cache**:
```rust
// parallel_chain_state.rs:557-594 (NEW CODE)
pub async fn reward_miner(&self, miner: &PublicKey, reward: u64) -> Result<(), BlockchainError> {
    // CONSENSUS FIX: Load existing balance from storage into accounts cache
    self.ensure_balance_loaded(miner, &TOS_ASSET).await?;

    // CONSENSUS FIX: Update balance in `accounts` cache (same cache used by transactions)
    if let Some(mut entry) = self.accounts.get_mut(miner) {
        let balance = entry.balances.entry(TOS_ASSET.clone()).or_insert(0);
        *balance = balance.saturating_add(reward);
    }

    Ok(())
}
```

**Key changes**:
1. Call `ensure_balance_loaded()` to load existing balance into `accounts` cache
2. Update balance in `accounts` (same cache transactions read from)
3. Accumulate reward on top of existing balance (fixes Bug #2)

---

## Bug #2: Balance Overwrite on Merge

### Root Cause

**Merge logic** (BROKEN):
```rust
// blockchain.rs:4621-4622 (OLD BEHAVIOR)
let modified_balances = parallel_state.get_modified_balances();
for ((account, asset), new_balance) in modified_balances {
    let versioned_balance = VersionedBalance::new(new_balance, Some(topoheight));
    storage.set_last_balance_to(&account, &asset, topoheight, &versioned_balance).await?;
                                                              // ↑ Directly overwrites with new_balance
}
```

**What `get_modified_balances()` returned** (BROKEN):
```rust
// parallel_chain_state.rs:586-591 (OLD CODE)
for entry in self.balances.iter() {
    for (asset, balance) in entry.value().iter() {
        result.push(((account.clone(), asset.clone()), *balance));
                                                         // ↑ Reward amount (NOT final balance)
    }
}
```

### Problem

`balances` DashMap stored only the reward amount (e.g., 5 TOS), not the final balance (existing + reward).

**Failure scenario**:
```
Block N-1: Miner has 10 TOS
Block N:   Miner receives 5 TOS reward
           → reward_miner() writes 5 to balances DashMap
           → merge writes 5 to storage
Result:    Miner balance = 5 TOS (lost 10 TOS!)
```

**Developer fee disaster scenario**:
```
Block N-1: DEV_PUBLIC_KEY has 1,000,000 TOS
Block N:   Dev fee = 0.5 TOS
           → reward_miner() writes 0.5 to balances DashMap
           → merge writes 0.5 to storage
Result:    Dev balance = 0.5 TOS (lost 999,999.5 TOS!)
```

### Fix

**Modified `get_modified_balances()` to only collect from `accounts` cache**:
```rust
// parallel_chain_state.rs:612-628 (NEW CODE)
pub fn get_modified_balances(&self) -> Vec<((PublicKey, Hash), u64)> {
    let mut result = Vec::new();

    // CONSENSUS FIX: Only collect from accounts cache
    // All balance changes (transactions + rewards) are tracked here
    for entry in self.accounts.iter() {
        let account = entry.key();
        for (asset, balance) in &entry.value().balances {
            result.push(((account.clone(), asset.clone()), *balance));
        }
    }

    // REMOVED: Collection from balances DashMap
    // Old code collected from self.balances, which caused the overwrite bug

    result
}
```

**Why this works**:
1. `reward_miner()` now loads existing balance into `accounts` and accumulates
2. `accounts` cache contains **final balances** (existing + reward), not deltas
3. Merge writes final balances to storage (correct behavior)

---

## Serial Execution Reference

**How serial path handles rewards** (correct):
```rust
// chain_state/mod.rs:459-468
pub async fn reward_miner(&mut self, miner: &'a PublicKey, reward: u64) -> Result<(), BlockchainError> {
    // Get receiver balance (loads existing balance from storage if needed)
    let miner_balance = self.internal_get_receiver_balance(Cow::Borrowed(miner), Cow::Borrowed(&TOS_ASSET)).await?;

    // Accumulate reward on existing balance
    *miner_balance = miner_balance.checked_add(reward)
        .ok_or(BlockchainError::Overflow)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

**Key behaviors parallel path must match**:
1. Load existing balance from storage
2. Accumulate reward on top of existing balance
3. Reward immediately visible to transaction execution
4. Final balance written to storage (not delta)

## Test Scenarios Verified

### ✅ Scenario 1: New miner (no existing balance)
- **Expected**: Final balance = reward amount
- **Result**: PASS

### ✅ Scenario 2: Existing miner receives reward
- **Before**: 10 TOS
- **Reward**: 5 TOS
- **Expected**: 15 TOS
- **Result**: PASS (previously failed - balance overwritten to 5 TOS)

### ✅ Scenario 3: Miner spends reward in same block
- **Expected**: Transaction succeeds
- **Result**: PASS (previously failed - reward invisible)

### ✅ Scenario 4: Dev fee address (large existing balance)
- **Before**: 1,000 TOS
- **Dev fee**: 0.5 TOS
- **Expected**: 1,000.5 TOS
- **Result**: PASS (previously failed - balance overwritten to 0.5 TOS)

### ✅ Scenario 5: Miner with existing balance spends (existing + reward)
- **Before**: 10 TOS
- **Reward**: 5 TOS
- **Spends**: 12 TOS
- **Expected**: Transaction succeeds, remaining 3 TOS
- **Result**: PASS (previously failed - only reward visible)

## Code Review Checklist

- [x] Rewards written to `accounts` cache (not `balances`)
- [x] Existing balance loaded before accumulation
- [x] Rewards immediately visible to transaction execution
- [x] Final balances (not deltas) written to storage
- [x] Parallel execution matches serial execution behavior
- [x] All test scenarios pass
- [x] Compilation succeeds with zero warnings

---

## Security Impact

**Before fix**:
- **Consensus divergence**: Parallel nodes != Serial nodes
- **Fund loss**: Existing balances overwritten
- **Functional regression**: Miners cannot spend rewards in same block

**After fix**:
- ✅ Consensus parity with serial execution
- ✅ Fund safety guaranteed
- ✅ All serial features work in parallel mode

---

## Future Cleanup

The `balances` DashMap in `ParallelChainState` is now **deprecated** and unused. Consider removing it in a future refactor:

```rust
// DEPRECATED: This field is no longer used (kept for backward compatibility)
// All balance operations now use `accounts` cache
balances: DashMap<PublicKey, HashMap<Hash, u64>>,
```

**Removal checklist**:
- [ ] Remove `balances` field from struct
- [ ] Remove `balances` initialization in `new()`
- [ ] Remove any remaining references (should be none)
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
