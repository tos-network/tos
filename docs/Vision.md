# TOS AI Mining Ecosystem Design

## Core Philosophy

Create a decentralized AI computation marketplace where AI agents participate in "Proof of Intelligent Work" mining, earning TOS rewards by solving real-world problems.

## Participant Roles

### 1. Task Publishers (Demand Side)

**Identity Definition:**
- Developers: Need code auditing and vulnerability detection
- Enterprises: Need data analysis and business intelligence
- DApp Projects: Need smart contract auditing
- Research Institutions: Need algorithm verification and data modeling

**Participation Motivation:**
- Access professional AI services at 60-80% lower cost than traditional consulting
- Get rapid results (hours vs traditional days/weeks)
- Multiple AIs working simultaneously for better quality

**Economic Investment:**
```
Task Publication Fee: 10-200 TOS (based on complexity)
Reward Fund: 20-500 TOS (for winning AI miners)
Stake Requirement: 50% of reward amount (prevent malicious tasks)
```

### 2. AI Miners (Supply Side)

**Identity Definition:**
- Individual Developers: Run open-source AI models for profit
- AI Companies: Monetize idle computing power
- Technical Teams: Develop specialized AI mining services
- Professional Institutions: Provide high-quality AI solutions

**Professional Specialization:**
```
Code Analysis Experts: Rust/Python/JavaScript security auditing

```

**Revenue Structure:**
```
Beginner Level: 5-15 TOS/task, 1-2 tasks daily
Skilled Level: 15-50 TOS/task, 2-4 tasks daily
Expert Level: 50-200 TOS/task, 1-3 tasks daily
Stake Requirement: 10-500 TOS (based on task value)
```

### 3. Validators (Quality Assurance)

**Validation Types:**

**Automatic Validators (System Level)**
- Verify code compilation results
- Check mathematical calculation accuracy
- Validate data format compliance
- Cost: System-borne

**Peer Validation (AI Miner Cross-Validation)**
- Other AI miners cross-validate answers
- Determine answer quality through voting
- Revenue: 1-5 TOS per validation
- Time: 5-30 minutes per validation

**Expert AI Validation (Advanced AI Models)**
- Specialized expert AI models provide in-depth review
- Handle complex technical disputes and innovation evaluation
- Revenue: 5-20 TOS per validation
- Time: 30 minutes-2 hours per validation
- AI Levels: Standard/Advanced/Specialist/Master

```

## Specific Interaction Flow

### Step 1: Task Publication
1. Publisher describes task requirements (code audit/data analysis, etc.)
2. Set reward amount and deadline
3. Stake reward funds to the system
4. Task enters public task pool

### Step 2: AI Miners Accept Tasks
1. AI miners browse task pool, select tasks they excel at
2. Stake certain amount of TOS (prevent malicious submissions)
3. Download task data, begin analysis and processing
4. Submit solutions within specified time

### Step 3: Answer Validation
**Simple Tasks (e.g., code syntax checking):**
- System automatically validates, immediate results
- Correct answers directly receive rewards

**Complex Tasks (e.g., security auditing):**
- Multiple AI miners submit answers
- Other AI miners perform cross-validation
- Determine best answer through voting or consensus

**Complex Tasks (Algorithm Innovation):**
- Expert AI models provide deep analysis
- Multi-round AI debates resolve disputes
- AI hierarchical review makes final judgment

### Step 4: Reward Distribution
```
Total Reward Pool Allocation:
- 60-70% → Winning AI miners
- 15-20% → AI peer validators
- 5-10% → Expert AI model operators
- 5-10% → TOS network maintenance fee
```

## Typical Application Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Smart Contract Security Audit
```
Publisher: DApp Development Team
Task: Audit 500 lines of Solidity code
Reward: 100 TOS
Deadline: 24 hours

Process:
1. 5 AI miners accept task, each stakes 20 TOS
2. After 24 hours, 3 submit audit reports
3. Automatic validation checks report format
4. Peer validation confirms discovered vulnerabilities
5. Expert AI validation confirms critical security issues
6. Best answer receives 70 TOS, others receive small rewards
```

### Scenario 2: Data Analysis Report
```
Publisher: E-commerce Enterprise
Task: Analyze user purchase behavior data
Reward: 50 TOS
Deadline: 6 hours

Process:
1. Data analysis specialist AI accepts task, stakes 10 TOS
2. After 6 hours, submits analysis report and visualizations
3. Automatic validation checks mathematical calculation accuracy
4. No disputes, directly receives 45 TOS reward
```

### Scenario 3: Algorithm Optimization Problem
```
Publisher: Research Institution
Task: Optimize image processing algorithm
Reward: 200 TOS
Deadline: 48 hours

Process:
1. Multiple AIs submit different optimization solutions
2. Automatic testing of performance improvement effects
3. Expert AI evaluation of algorithm innovation
4. Optimal solution receives 140 TOS + future collaboration opportunities
```

## Anti-Fraud Mechanisms

### Time Verification
- Set minimum thinking time after task publication
- Excessively fast submissions flagged as suspicious
- Prevent pre-computation and brute force attacks

### Quality Check
- Answers must include reasoning process
- Check answer complexity and logic
- Simple copy-paste will be identified

### Behavioral Analysis
- Monitor AI miners' submission patterns
- Detect abnormally high success rates
- Identify potential collusion fraud

### Economic Constraints
- Staking mechanism prevents malicious submissions
- Incorrect answers result in partial stake deduction
- Serious fraud results in permanent ban

## Economic Incentive Design

### Base Reward Table
```
Task Type             Base Reward   Difficulty Factor   Final Reward Range
Code Syntax Check     5 TOS        1.0-2.0            5-10 TOS
Data Statistical Analysis  15 TOS   1.0-3.0            15-45 TOS
Security Vulnerability Audit  50 TOS  1.0-4.0         50-200 TOS
Algorithm Optimization Design  100 TOS  1.0-5.0       100-500 TOS
```

### Dynamic Adjustment Mechanism
- Low task completion rate → Automatically increase rewards
- High task completion rate → Appropriately reduce rewards
- Maintain supply-demand balance

### Reputation System
```
Reputation Level   Success Rate Requirement   Reward Bonus   Priority
Beginner          No requirement             0%             Low
Skilled           >70%                       +10%           Medium
Expert            >85%                       +20%           High
Master            >95%                       +30%           Highest
```

pub enum AIMiningPayload {
    PublishTask { ... },     // Publish task
    SubmitAnswer { ... },    // Submit answer
    ValidateAnswer { ... },  // Validate answer
    Challenge { ... },       // Challenge result
}

// AI miner state
pub struct AIMinerState {
    pub reputation: u32,     // Reputation score
    pub success_rate: f64,   // Success rate
    pub specialization: Vec<TaskType>, // Areas of expertise
}
```

## Expected Revenue Analysis

- System attacked and exploited → Comprehensive anti-fraud system
- Network congestion → Reasonable energy consumption design

### Economic Risks
- Inappropriate reward settings → Dynamic adjustment mechanism
