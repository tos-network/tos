# Insurance-Backed Credit Contract Specification

## Overview

This document specifies the smart contract for providing insurance-backed credit lines to enable offline payments on the TOS blockchain. The contract allows users to deposit collateral, receive credit certificates, make offline payments, and automatically settle when connectivity is restored.

## Contract Architecture

## Core Contract Functions

### 1. Credit Line Management

#### `deposit_collateral(tier: CreditTier) -> Result<CreditLine, ContractError>`

Deposit collateral and establish a credit line.

**Parameters:**
- `tier`: Desired credit tier (Tier1, Tier2, or Tier3)

**Process:**
1. Validate tier requirements (collateral amount, premium)
2. Transfer collateral from user to contract
3. Generate unique certificate ID
4. Calculate credit limit based on tier and collateral
5. Create credit line record
6. Emit `CreditLineCreated` event

**Returns:**
- `CreditLine`: Newly created credit line with certificate

**Errors:**
- `InsufficientCollateral`: Collateral below tier requirements
- `ContractPaused`: Contract is paused or shut down
- `CreditLineAlreadyExists`: User already has active credit line

**Example:**
```rust
// User deposits 250 TOS for Tier 2 (500 USDT limit)
let credit_line = contract.deposit_collateral(CreditTier::Tier2)?;

// credit_line.certificate_id: [u8; 32]
// credit_line.credit_limit: 500 USDT equivalent
// credit_line.collateral_amount: 250 TOS
// credit_line.expires_at: now + 90 days
```

#### `withdraw_collateral() -> Result<u64, ContractError>`

Withdraw collateral and close credit line.

**Process:**
1. Validate credit line status (no outstanding debt)
2. Calculate interest earned on collateral
3. Apply early withdrawal penalty if applicable
4. Transfer collateral + interest back to user
5. Mark credit line as closed
6. Emit `CreditLineClosed` event

**Returns:**
- `u64`: Amount withdrawn (collateral + interest - penalties)

**Errors:**
- `OutstandingDebt`: Cannot withdraw with unpaid debt
- `CreditLineNotFound`: No active credit line
- `WithdrawalTimeLock`: Withdrawal time lock not expired

**Example:**
```rust
// User withdraws collateral after 90 days
let withdrawn = contract.withdraw_collateral()?;

// withdrawn: 250 TOS + 3.125 TOS interest (5% APY) = 253.125 TOS
```

#### `extend_credit_line(additional_months: u8) -> Result<u64, ContractError>`

Extend credit line expiration by paying additional premiums.

**Parameters:**
- `additional_months`: Number of months to extend (1-12)

**Process:**
1. Calculate premium for extension period
2. Transfer premium from user to insurance pool
3. Update expiration timestamp
4. Emit `CreditLineExtended` event

**Returns:**
- `u64`: New expiration timestamp

**Example:**
```rust
// Extend credit line by 3 months
let new_expiration = contract.extend_credit_line(3)?;

// Premium paid: 3 months × 1 TOS = 3 TOS
// new_expiration: current expiration + 90 days
```

### 2. Offline Payment Settlement

#### `settle_offline_payment(proof: OfflinePaymentProof) -> Result<SettlementResult, ContractError>`

Settle an offline payment when connectivity is restored.

**Parameters:**
- `proof`: Offline payment proof signed by customer and merchant

**Process:**
1. **Validate payment proof:**
   - Verify customer signature
   - Verify merchant signature (if present)
   - Check certificate ID exists and is active
   - Check nonce not reused (replay protection)
   - Check proof not expired
   - Check credit limit not exceeded

2. **Attempt user balance settlement:**
   - Query user's current balance
   - If balance ≥ amount:
     - Transfer from user to merchant
     - Mark nonce as used
     - Emit `PaymentSettledByUser` event
     - Return success

3. **Insurance settlement (if insufficient balance):**
   - Transfer from insurance pool to merchant
   - Increment `used_credit` on credit line
   - Record debt against user
   - Mark nonce as used
   - Update credit line status to `Suspended`
   - Emit `PaymentSettledByInsurance` event
   - Emit `DebtCreated` event
   - Return success with debt recorded

**Returns:**
```rust
pub struct SettlementResult {
    /// Settlement method used
    settled_by: SettlementMethod,

    /// Amount settled (in nanoTOS)
    amount: u64,

    /// Merchant address
    merchant: Address,

    /// Remaining credit available
    remaining_credit: u64,

    /// Debt created (if insurance paid)
    debt_created: Option<u64>,
}

pub enum SettlementMethod {
    UserBalance,
    Insurance,
}
```

**Errors:**
- `InvalidSignature`: Signature verification failed
- `CertificateNotFound`: Certificate ID not recognized
- `CreditLineExpired`: Credit line expired
- `CreditLineInactive`: Credit line not active
- `NonceReused`: Nonce already used (replay attack)
- `ProofExpired`: Payment proof expired
- `CreditLimitExceeded`: Payment exceeds available credit
- `InsufficientInsurancePool`: Insurance pool depleted

**Example:**
```rust
// Settle offline payment (user has sufficient balance)
let result = contract.settle_offline_payment(proof)?;

// result.settled_by: SettlementMethod::UserBalance
// result.amount: 50 TOS
// result.merchant: tst1yyy...
// result.remaining_credit: 450 USDT
// result.debt_created: None

// Settle offline payment (insufficient balance, insurance pays)
let result = contract.settle_offline_payment(proof)?;

// result.settled_by: SettlementMethod::Insurance
// result.amount: 50 TOS
// result.merchant: tst1yyy...
// result.remaining_credit: 0 (suspended)
// result.debt_created: Some(50 TOS)
```

#### `batch_settle_payments(proofs: Vec<OfflinePaymentProof>) -> Result<Vec<SettlementResult>, ContractError>`

Settle multiple offline payments in a single transaction (gas optimization).

**Parameters:**
- `proofs`: Vector of offline payment proofs

**Process:**
1. Validate all proofs (fail fast if any invalid)
2. Sort by timestamp (oldest first)
3. Settle each payment sequentially
4. Aggregate results
5. Emit `BatchSettlementCompleted` event

**Returns:**
- `Vec<SettlementResult>`: Results for each payment

**Gas Savings:**
- Single transaction: ~100,000 gas
- 10 payments: ~150,000 gas (50% savings vs 10 separate transactions)

**Example:**
```rust
// Settle 10 offline payments from past 24 hours
let proofs = vec![proof1, proof2, ..., proof10];
let results = contract.batch_settle_payments(proofs)?;

// results[0].settled_by: SettlementMethod::UserBalance
// results[1].settled_by: SettlementMethod::UserBalance
// ...
// results[9].settled_by: SettlementMethod::Insurance (last one failed)
```

### 3. Debt Management

#### `repay_debt(amount: u64) -> Result<DebtStatus, ContractError>`

Repay outstanding debt to insurance pool and reactivate credit line.

**Parameters:**
- `amount`: Amount to repay (in nanoTOS)

**Process:**
1. Validate credit line exists and has debt
2. Transfer repayment from user to insurance pool
3. Deduct from `used_credit` and `total_debt`
4. If fully repaid:
   - Reactivate credit line
   - Reset settlement window
5. Emit `DebtRepaid` event

**Returns:**
```rust
pub struct DebtStatus {
    /// Remaining debt
    remaining_debt: u64,

    /// Credit line status after repayment
    status: CreditStatus,

    /// Available credit after repayment
    available_credit: u64,
}
```

**Example:**
```rust
// Repay 50 TOS debt
let status = contract.repay_debt(50_000_000_000)?; // 50 TOS in nanoTOS

// status.remaining_debt: 0
// status.status: CreditStatus::Active
// status.available_credit: 500 USDT
```

#### `liquidate_defaulted_account(user: Address) -> Result<u64, ContractError>`

Liquidate collateral from defaulted account (only callable by contract owner).

**Parameters:**
- `user`: Address of defaulted user

**Process:**
1. Validate credit line is in `Defaulted` status
2. Calculate liquidation amount:
   - Outstanding debt
   - Late payment fees
   - Default penalty
3. Transfer collateral to insurance pool
4. Close credit line
5. Emit `AccountLiquidated` event

**Returns:**
- `u64`: Amount liquidated

**Authorization:**
- Only contract owner (insurance provider)

**Example:**
```rust
// Liquidate user who defaulted on 50 TOS debt
let liquidated = contract.liquidate_defaulted_account(user_address)?;

// liquidated: 50 TOS (debt) + 5 TOS (late fees) + 2.5 TOS (penalty) = 57.5 TOS
// Remaining collateral (250 - 57.5 = 192.5 TOS) returned to user
```

### 4. Administrative Functions

#### `pause_contract() -> Result<(), ContractError>`

Pause contract operations (emergency stop).

**Authorization:** Only contract owner

**Effect:**
- No new credit lines can be created
- No new settlements accepted
- Existing credit lines can repay debt or withdraw collateral

#### `resume_contract() -> Result<(), ContractError>`

Resume contract operations after pause.

**Authorization:** Only contract owner

#### `update_params(new_params: ContractParams) -> Result<(), ContractError>`

Update contract parameters (fees, limits, oracle, etc.).

**Authorization:** Only contract owner

**Validation:**
- Cannot increase fees beyond 5%
- Cannot decrease credit limits for existing users
- Oracle address must be valid

#### `deposit_insurance_pool(amount: u64) -> Result<u64, ContractError>`

Add funds to insurance pool (capitalize the insurance fund).

**Authorization:** Anyone can deposit (but only owner can withdraw)

**Returns:**
- `u64`: New insurance pool balance

#### `withdraw_insurance_pool(amount: u64) -> Result<u64, ContractError>`

Withdraw excess funds from insurance pool.

**Authorization:** Only contract owner

**Validation:**
- Cannot withdraw below minimum reserve ratio (e.g., 20% of total outstanding credit)

## Events

```rust
/// Event emitted when credit line is created
pub struct CreditLineCreated {
    user: Address,
    tier: CreditTier,
    credit_limit: u64,
    collateral_amount: u64,
    certificate_id: [u8; 32],
    expires_at: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when credit line is closed
pub struct CreditLineClosed {
    user: Address,
    collateral_withdrawn: u64,
    interest_earned: u64,
    penalty_applied: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when credit line is extended
pub struct CreditLineExtended {
    user: Address,
    premium_paid: u64,
    new_expiration: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when payment is settled by user
pub struct PaymentSettledByUser {
    user: Address,
    merchant: Address,
    amount: u64,
    nonce: [u8; 32],
    timestamp: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when payment is settled by insurance
pub struct PaymentSettledByInsurance {
    user: Address,
    merchant: Address,
    amount: u64,
    nonce: [u8; 32],
    timestamp: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when debt is created
pub struct DebtCreated {
    debtor: Address,
    amount: u64,
    due_date: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when debt is repaid
pub struct DebtRepaid {
    user: Address,
    amount_repaid: u64,
    remaining_debt: u64,
}

/// Event emitted when account is liquidated
pub struct AccountLiquidated {
    user: Address,
    debt_amount: u64,
    collateral_seized: u64,
    collateral_returned: u64,
}

/// Event emitted on batch settlement completion
pub struct BatchSettlementCompleted {
    total_payments: u64,
    total_amount: u64,
    settled_by_user: u64,
    settled_by_insurance: u64,
}
```

## Security Mechanisms

### 1. Replay Attack Prevention

**Nonce System:**
- Each offline payment proof includes a cryptographically random 32-byte nonce
- Contract maintains `HashMap<[u8; 32], bool>` of used nonces
- Settlement function checks nonce not reused before processing
- Nonce space: 2^256 combinations (practically infinite)

**Optimization:**
- Use bloom filter for fast nonce lookup (99.9% accuracy)
- Store confirmed nonces in persistent database
- Prune nonces older than 1 year (garbage collection)

### 2. Signature Verification

**Customer Signature:**
- Proves customer authorized the payment
- Signature covers: `hash(from_address, to_address, amount, memo, nonce, timestamp)`
- Uses ECDSA secp256k1 (same as TOS wallet signatures)

**Merchant Signature (Optional):**
- Proves merchant delivered goods/services
- Provides additional fraud protection
- If missing: payment still valid (but merchant assumes risk)

### 3. Credit Limit Enforcement

**Per-Transaction Check:**
```rust
if credit_line.used_credit + payment.amount > credit_line.credit_limit {
    return Err(ContractError::CreditLimitExceeded);
}
```

**Aggregate Limit Check:**
```rust
if total_outstanding + payment.amount > insurance_pool * 5 {
    return Err(ContractError::InsufficientInsurancePool);
}
```

**Reserve Ratio:**
- Insurance pool must maintain 20% reserve
- If reserve < 20%, no new credit lines issued
- Existing credit lines remain active

### 4. Time-Based Protections

**Payment Proof Expiration:**
- Each proof has `expires_at` timestamp (typically now + 1 hour)
- Settlement rejected if `current_timestamp > expires_at`
- Prevents stale payment proofs from being replayed

**Credit Line Expiration:**
- Credit lines expire after 90 days (configurable)
- Expired credit lines cannot be used for new payments
- Existing settlements still processed (grace period: 7 days)

**Settlement Window:**
- Tier 1: 24 hours to settle
- Tier 2: 7 days to settle
- Tier 3: 30 days to settle
- Late settlements incur 1% fee per week

### 5. Multi-Signature Withdrawal

**Insurance Pool Withdrawal:**
- Requires 2-of-3 multi-signature approval
- Signers: Insurance provider + 2 independent auditors
- Time lock: 7-day delay before execution
- Prevents rug pull / fund theft

### 6. Circuit Breaker (Emergency Pause)

**Triggered when:**
- Insurance pool depleted below 10%
- Abnormal settlement volume (>10x average)
- Smart contract bug detected

**Effect:**
- New credit lines disabled
- New settlements disabled
- Users can still repay debt and withdraw collateral

## Economic Parameters

### Default Configuration

```rust
ContractParams {
    // Minimum 1 TOS collateral
    min_collateral: 1_000_000_000,  // 1 TOS in nanoTOS

    // Maximum 10,000 TOS credit limit per user
    max_credit_limit: 10_000_000_000_000,  // 10,000 TOS in nanoTOS

    // Late payment fee: 1% per week (100 basis points)
    late_fee_bps: 100,

    // Default penalty: 5% of outstanding debt (500 basis points)
    default_penalty_bps: 500,

    // Early withdrawal penalty: 1% of collateral (100 basis points)
    early_withdrawal_penalty_bps: 100,

    // Collateral interest rate: 5% APY (500 basis points)
    collateral_interest_bps: 500,

    // Payment proof valid for 1 hour (3600 seconds)
    proof_expiration_window: 3600,

    // Maximum settlement delay: 30 days (2,592,000 seconds)
    max_settlement_delay: 2_592_000,

    // Price oracle address (TOS/USDT)
    price_oracle: Address::from_str("tst1oracle...")?,
}
```

### Credit Tier Configurations

```rust
// Tier 1: Low Credit (No Collateral)
CreditTier::Tier1 {
    credit_limit: 100_000_000_000,  // 100 USDT equivalent in TOS
    monthly_premium: 2_000_000_000,  // 2 TOS per month
    settlement_window: 86_400,  // 24 hours
}

// Tier 2: Medium Credit (50% Collateral)
CreditTier::Tier2 {
    credit_limit: 500_000_000_000,  // 500 USDT equivalent in TOS
    collateral_ratio: 5000,  // 50% (5000/10000)
    monthly_premium: 1_000_000_000,  // 1 TOS per month
    settlement_window: 604_800,  // 7 days
}

// Tier 3: High Credit (100% Collateral)
CreditTier::Tier3 {
    credit_limit: 2_000_000_000_000,  // 2000 USDT equivalent in TOS
    collateral_ratio: 10000,  // 100% (10000/10000)
    monthly_premium: 0,  // Free (covered by interest)
    settlement_window: 2_592_000,  // 30 days
}
```

## Gas Optimization

### Batch Operations

**Individual Settlement:**
- Gas cost: ~100,000 per transaction
- Throughput: 10 TPS (limited by block gas limit)

**Batch Settlement (10 payments):**
- Gas cost: ~150,000 total (15,000 per payment)
- Throughput: 66 TPS (6.6x improvement)
- Savings: 85% gas reduction

### Storage Optimization

**Nonce Storage (Bloom Filter):**
- Standard HashMap: 64 bytes per nonce (key + value)
- Bloom filter: 1 byte per nonce (99.9% accuracy)
- **98.4% storage reduction**

**Credit Line Packing:**
- Pack multiple fields into single `u256` storage slot
- Example: `status (8 bits) | tier (8 bits) | settlement_count (32 bits) | ...`
- **50% storage cost reduction**

### Event Compression

**Indexed Fields:**
- Only index essential fields for filtering (user, merchant, timestamp)
- Store large data (payment proof, signatures) off-chain
- Link via content hash (IPFS CID or on-chain hash)

**Example:**
```rust
// Instead of storing full payment proof in event:
pub struct PaymentSettled {
    user: Address,           // Indexed
    merchant: Address,       // Indexed
    amount: u64,
    timestamp: u64,          // Indexed
    proof_hash: [u8; 32],    // Link to off-chain storage
}
```

## Conclusion

This insurance-backed credit contract enables true offline payments on TOS blockchain while maintaining security and decentralization. The three-tier system balances accessibility (Tier 1), flexibility (Tier 2), and capital efficiency (Tier 3).

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Zero-Knowledge Settlements:** Offline payments don't require real-time blockchain access
2. **Insurance Guarantee:** Merchants always get paid (within credit limits)
3. **Economic Alignment:** Premiums + collateral interest fund insurance pool
4. **On-Chain Enforcement:** Smart contracts prevent disputes and fraud

**Next Steps:**

1. Implement contract in Rust (using TOS smart contract SDK)
2. Write comprehensive test suite (unit + integration + security)
3. Deploy to testnet and run 30-day trial with 100 users
4. Audit by external security firm (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin)
5. Mainnet deployment with conservative limits (Tier 1 only initially)
6. Gradually enable Tier 2/3 after 90 days of stable operation
