# Codebase vs Whitepaper Alignment Audit (October 2025)

This document summarizes the review comparing the OpenSystem Network source code (~/tos-network/tos) with the latest whitepaper draft (tos.tex).

## 1. Components Present in the Repository
- **BlockDAG Consensus**: Fully implemented in Rust (daemon/src/core), including PoW mining, difficulty, and storage.
- **Proof of Intelligent Work (PoIW)**: Rust modules (`common/src/ai_mining/`) and CLI tools (`ai_miner/`) implement task publication, answer submission, validation, and reward logic. Python scripts provide end-to-end demos.
- **Energy Model / Staking**: `common/src/account/energy.rs` manages freeze durations, energy credits, and fee subsidies.
- **Wallet & Genesis Utilities**: Wallet, miner, and genesis components support core-like functionality.

These align with the “Foundations (Ship Mode)” chapter of the whitepaper.

## 2. Gaps vs. Whitepaper Narrative
While the code supports a production-ready PoW + BlockDAG + PoIW stack, several whitepaper features are not yet implemented:
- **Naming**: Code references “Proof of Intelligent Work (PoIW)” whereas the whitepaper uses “AGI Work (AGIW).”
- **Digital Personhood / DID Stack**: No DID or credential management modules are in the repository.
- **Compute/Energy Credits (CC/EC)**: Apart from energy credits linked to staking, there is no implementation of CC/EC tokens or price oracles.
- **Power of AI (PAI) Consensus**: No AI-assisted consensus scheduling or hybrid consensus in code.
- **Policy Compiler & Constitutional Contracts**: Only design docs—no on-chain implementation.
- **Reversible History / Interplanetary Features**: Not present.

Many advanced features described in the whitepaper should therefore be treated as roadmap items, not current capabilities.

## 3. Documentation & References
- The repo’s `docs/` directory contains PoIW design notes and status reports but lacks references to Digital Identity, PAI, or CC/EC implementation.
- The whitepaper’s References section must include Bitcoin’s and Ethereum’s whitepapers and the Java Virtual Machine Specification; these citations are currently missing.

## 4. Recommendations
1. **Audit Claims**: Clarify in the whitepaper that Digital Personhood, CC/EC markets, PAI, and governance tooling are future phases with explicit timelines.
2. **Terminology Alignment**: Rename PoIW references in code and documentation to AGIW to match the whitepaper.
3. **Citation Updates**: Add the required references (Bitcoin, Ethereum, JVM Spec) to the whitepaper.
4. **Implementation Status Appendix**: Include a mapping of existing modules to whitepaper sections and a roadmap for future work.
5. **Documentation Refresh**: Update `AI_MINING_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` or create a new section to track progress on AGIW, CC/EC, and PAI features.

## 5. Conclusion
The Rust codebase robustly implements the foundational OpenSystem stack (BlockDAG + PoW + PoIW/AGIW + energy model). However, the more ambitious features described in the whitepaper—identity, compute/energy tokens, AI-assisted consensus, formal policy tooling—remain unimplemented. Aligning both terminology and roadmap expectations will make the whitepaper more credible, and adding the missing citations will satisfy the documentation requirements.
