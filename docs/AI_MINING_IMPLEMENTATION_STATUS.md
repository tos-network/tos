- **Length-based Gas Pricing**: 0.001 TOS per byte for both task descriptions and answer content
- **UTF-8 Validation**: Ensure proper encoding for international content
- **Spam Prevention**: 10-2048 byte limits with gas-based cost model

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Meaningful Validation**: Validators can now see and properly evaluate actual answers
- ✅ **Content Integrity**: Hash verification combined with direct storage
- ✅ **Economic Incentives**: Length-based pricing prevents spam while allowing detailed responses
- ✅ **Internationalization**: Full UTF-8 support for global participation

### Known Limitations

1. **Real AI Integration**: Currently uses simulated AI computation (placeholder for actual AI models)
2. **Advanced Validation**: Validation scoring implemented with content analysis capability
3. **UI Interface**: CLI-only (web interface can be added as needed)
4. **Content Size**: Limited to 2KB per answer/description (sufficient for most AI tasks)

## 🔮 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. **AI Model Integration**: Integrate actual AI/ML models for real computation
2. **Advanced Validation**: Implement sophisticated answer validation algorithms
3. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Web-based monitoring and management interface
4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for high-throughput scenarios

### Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-chain Support**: Support for multiple blockchain networks
2. **Advanced Task Types**: Support for complex AI task categories
3. **Reputation System**: Implement miner reputation and scoring
4. **Mobile Support**: Mobile app for AI mining participation
