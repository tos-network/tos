## Architecture Validation

### ✅ Confirmed Design Decisions

1. **DashMap for Per-Account Locking**
   - Concurrent tests show high RwLock contention (50+ workers)
   - Validates need for fine-grained per-account locking
   - DashMap in ParallelChainState is correct architecture

2. **Cache-First Strategy**
   - 15.6x speedup on cache hits confirms effectiveness
   - Pre-loading accounts for parallel execution is beneficial
   - Justifies ensure_account_loaded() / ensure_balance_loaded() design

3. **Modification Tracking**
   - Commit time scales linearly with modified accounts
   - Only writing changed values reduces I/O overhead
   - original_nonce / original_balance tracking is efficient

4. **ParallelChainState Initialization**
   - Near-zero overhead (0.01ms) confirms Arc-based design
   - No lifetime constraints enable easy cloning for parallel workers
   - Validates simplification from lifetime-bound version

### ⚠️ Areas for Investigation

1. **Write Performance (Debug Mode)**
   - Below baseline, but likely acceptable in release build
   - Consider RocksDB WriteBatch for bulk operations
   - Profile to identify specific bottlenecks

2. **Concurrent Write Contention**
   - Expected with RwLock, but higher than anticipated
   - Confirms parallel execution should minimize storage access
   - May benefit from write batching strategies

## Appendix: Baseline Expectations

Performance baselines (modern hardware, release build):
- **Write operations:** 10,000-50,000 ops/sec
- **Read operations:** 50,000-200,000 ops/sec
- **Concurrent operations (10 threads):** 5,000-20,000 ops/sec
- **ParallelChainState creation:** < 10ms
- **State commit:** < 100ms for 100 accounts

Debug build typically runs 3-10x slower than release build.
