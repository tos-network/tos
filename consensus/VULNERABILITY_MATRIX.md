## Detailed Vulnerability Cards

### V-01: Integer Overflow in Blue Score
```
Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  MEDIUM (requires sustained mining power)
Impact:          EXTREME (consensus failure, double-spend)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Attacker controls ~20% hashrate
- Can maintain private chain for weeks/months
- Can create specific mergeset structures

Attack Steps:
1. Build private chain approaching u64::MAX blue_score
2. Wait for honest chain to reach similar score
3. Create merge causing overflow in honest chain
4. Publish higher-work chain without overflow
5. Network reorgs to attacker's chain

Detection:
- Monitor for chains with blue_score > u64::MAX - 10000
- Alert on blue_work inconsistencies

Mitigation:
- Use checked arithmetic
- Reject blocks causing overflow
```

### V-02: Reachability Interval Exhaustion
```
Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  EASY (single attacker, low hashrate)
Impact:          HIGH (network-wide DoS)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Can mine 64 consecutive blocks
- ~1 hour mining time at 1s block time

Attack Steps:
1. Mine 64-block single-parent chain
2. Intervals split 64 times: 2^64 divisions
3. Parent intervals become size 0 or 1
4. Next block cannot allocate interval
5. Network halts

Detection:
- Monitor interval sizes in reachability data
- Alert when intervals < 1000

Mitigation:
- Implement interval reindexing (Kaspa's algorithm)
- Reject blocks when intervals too small
- Trigger reindexing at threshold
```

### V-03: K-Cluster Validation Bypass
```
Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  MEDIUM (requires DAG structure understanding)
Impact:          EXTREME (consensus violation, chain split)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Understanding of GHOSTDAG algorithm
- Ability to create specific DAG structures
- Can publish blocks with >k anticone blues

Attack Steps:
1. Create block B with parent A
2. Mark A as blue (in anticone check)
3. Add k+1 blocks where some are ancestors
4. Simplified validator incorrectly counts ancestors
5. Block accepted with >k anticone blues

Detection:
- Full k-cluster validation on suspicious blocks
- Compare with Kaspa node results

Mitigation:
- Implement proper reachability-based anticone check
- Use is_dag_ancestor_of() to skip ancestors
```

### V-04: Race Condition in Block Processing

Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  HARD (requires precise timing)
Impact:          HIGH (corrupted GHOSTDAG state)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Control over block arrival timing
- Ability to submit blocks concurrently
- Deep understanding of storage layer

Attack Steps:
1. Submit Block A and B simultaneously
2. Both read same parent GHOSTDAG data

4. B completes with stale parent data
5. Inconsistent state written to storage

Detection:
- Verify GHOSTDAG data consistency
- Check for blue_work monotonicity violations

Mitigation:
- Use transactional storage

- OR exploit cache poisoning
- OR provide fake parent data

Attack Steps:
1. Create block with fake parent hash
2. Poison cache with fake GHOSTDAG data
3. find_selected_parent() reads fake data
4. Block builds on invalid foundation

Detection:
- Validate all parent blocks exist
- Check parent consistency

Mitigation:
- Validate parent existence before selection

- Check parent topoheight ordering
```

### V-06: Work Calculation Division
```
Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  HARD (requires U256 conversion edge case)
Impact:          MEDIUM (node crash)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Find difficulty value that converts to zero
- Requires deep U256 conversion knowledge

Attack Steps:
1. Submit block with specially crafted difficulty
2. Conversion produces zero after type change

Severity:        CRITICAL
Exploitability:  EASY (single miner can exploit)
Impact:          HIGH (difficulty manipulation)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Control of single block timestamp
- Understanding of DAA window

Attack Steps:
1. Set block timestamp far in future
2. DAA sees huge actual_time
3. Ratio calculated as very low
4. Difficulty drops (clamped to 0.25x)
5. Repeat to drive difficulty down
6. Easier to 51% attack

Detection:
- Monitor for blocks with future timestamps

```
Severity:        HIGH
Exploitability:  MEDIUM (during reachability migration)
Impact:          MEDIUM (temporary consensus issues)

Attack Prerequisites:
- Network in reachability migration state
- Some blocks lack reachability data
- Understanding of blue_score distribution

Attack Steps:
1. During migration, create blocks near boundary
2. Heuristic blue_score + 10 misclassifies
